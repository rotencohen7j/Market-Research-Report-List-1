<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultraviolet Spectrograph Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Beam</li><li>Double-Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultraviolet Spectrograph market is primarily divided into two types: Single-Beam and Double-Beam spectrographs. Single-Beam spectrographs measure absorbance by directing UV light through a sample and detecting the transmitted light intensity, making them simpler and more affordable. In contrast, Double-Beam spectrographs split the light path into two beamsâ€”one directed through the sample and the other through a reference. This design enhances accuracy and stability by compensating for fluctuations in light source intensity, making them preferable for precise measurements.</p></p>
